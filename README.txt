About the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese:
The Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) is a database of spoken
Japanese developed by the Japan's national priority area research
project "Spontaneous Speech: Corpus and Processing Technology".
It contains about 650 hours of speech consisting of approximately
7.5 million words that were provided by more than 1,400 speakers.
For more details about the corpus, please visit the website of the
National Institute for Japanese Language (NINJAL). It is available
from the Institute.

Japanese Newspaper Article Sentences (JNAS)
This corpus consists of 16 CD-ROMs. It contains speech recordings 
and their orthographic transcriptions of 306 speakers (153 males 
and females each) reading excerpts from the Mainichi Newspaper 
and the ATR 503 PB- Sentences. All utterances and sentences are 
in the Japanese language. We prepared 155 text sets. Each set 
consists of about 100 sentences from the Mainichi Newspaper. 
As a general rule, each text set was read by one male and one 
female. Every speaker also read any subset of the ATR 503 
PB-Sentences (about 50 sentences for each subset). That is, 
this corpus contains utterances of about 45,000 sentences as 
a whole with all speakers reading about 150 sentences each. 
Each utterance was recorded with two microphones: a head-set 
microphone (all recoding sites used Sennheiser HMD410/HMD25-1 
or the equivalent) and a desk-top microphone of different types 
at each site (Sanken, Sony, and so on).  
The speech waves were sampled at 16 kHz and quantized into 16 bits. 
They are stored in the compressed format mentioned below. 
The Speech Database Committee of the Acoustical Society of Japan, 
established in July 1990, has discussed the design and creation of 
this corpus, which has been recorded in collaboration with 
39 institutions. 


Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.
(The recipe supports the third and fourth editions of CSJ.)
